# Simple Weather

_An abandoned Flash component , circa 2009_

Generates Snow or Rain type effects. Just drag the component onto the stage and size it. Then in the parameters, enter the Linkage Id (now a Class name) of the item you want to use as a rain drop or a snowflake. The component comes preinstalled with a snow flake to get you started.
